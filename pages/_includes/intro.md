###  Introduction

This is the SNOMED CT implementation guide for FHIR. 

This implementation guide contains:
* mappings from FHIR defined concepts (e.g. codes in code systems, and value sets) to SNOMED CT concepts
* mappings from FHIR resources to the SNOMED CT concept model
* Conformance rules for a FHIR terminology service that provides services for SNOMED CT implementations.

Note, though, that HL7 and SNOMED International may decide to additionally publish some or all of these things elsewhere.
