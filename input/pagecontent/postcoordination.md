Post Coordination in SNOMED CT
==============================

### Support for SNOMED CT Post Coordination in FHIR

FHIR has great support for SNOMED CT's post coordination.  It makes the whole business very easy by taking this broad approach: A SNOMED CT Post Coordinated Concept IS A SNOMED CT Concept.  So anywhere where you see a SNOMED CT code being used, you can - in theory - equally use a post coordinated expression.

SNOMED International has published a [Practical Guide to Postcoordination, which can be found here](https://snomed.org/postcoordination).
