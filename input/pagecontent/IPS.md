# International Patient Summary (IPS)

### What is the IPS?
The IPS is an electronic health record extract containing essential healthcare information for use in circumstances where citizens may travel from their home country and require unscheduled and unanticipated health care from a different jurisdiction, as well as for local, regional and other care scenarios. It is a minimal, non-exhaustive set of data elements defined by ISO/EN 17269 and delivered by HL7 in both CDA and FHIR using a curated set of SNOMED CT terms. The IPS Terminology is the next evolution of the HL7 IPS free set, providing advanced terminology features for non-Affiliates to use in their IPS implementations.

The content of the IPS can be accessed in [this browser](https://ips-browser.snomedtools.org/).

### Using the IPS with full SNOMED CT
It is worth noting that current SNOMED CT users, those located in a SNOMED International Member region or those with an Affiliate license to a complete SNOMED CT edition, should avoid use of the IPS Terminology and instead, implement their IPS solutions using a full edition of SNOMED CT. To share IPS data with non-Affiliates, licensed users may choose to refer to the IPS Reference Set. This reference set identifies the subset of key concepts from the IPS Terminology and is available as a supplementary package from SNOMED International's MLDS service.
